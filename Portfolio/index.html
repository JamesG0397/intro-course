    <h2><em>About me</em></h2>
    <p>
My hobbies have always been a huge part of my life, beginning with a devotion for Rugby, Cricket and Football, and recently spreading into powerlifting. These hobbies have meant that health and fitness is a hugely important part of my life and is where I spend most of my time socially. I have also spent 6 months traveling around Oceania and south east Asia, this along with my time at university has made me much more of an outgoing and confident individual. I have also completed a degree in medical biochemistry, something I take great pride in, but which has also helped me to develop social skills and a motivation to succeed in my future endeavours. I am now looking for a job somewhere I can be a valued member of an organisation but also a place where I can be challenged in order to improve and develop into a better and well-rounded worker. </p>
